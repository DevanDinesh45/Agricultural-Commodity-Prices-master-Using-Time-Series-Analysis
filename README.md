Introduction
The agricultural sector is highly dependent on commodity prices, which can be influenced by factors such as weather conditions, demand-supply dynamics, government policies, and global market trends. Analyzing historical price data using time series analysis techniques can provide valuable insights into price movements, seasonal patterns, and long-term trends, helping stakeholders in the agricultural industry make informed decisions.

This project utilizes time series analysis methods, including but not limited to:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Seasonal Decomposition
Exponential Smoothing
Holt-Winters Method
Features
Download historical commodity price data from reliable sources.
Preprocess and clean the data to remove outliers and missing values.
Analyze time series data using various statistical and machine learning techniques.
Visualize price trends, seasonality, and forecasted values using charts and graphs.
Evaluate model performance and accuracy metrics.
